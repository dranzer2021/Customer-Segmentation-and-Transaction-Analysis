# Customer Segmentation Model  

## Project Overview  
This project implements a **comprehensive customer segmentation model** using transactional data to help businesses optimize their strategies. The model analyzes customer behaviors, identifies unique patterns, and generates actionable insights to enable personalized marketing, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue.  

The solution is designed for easy deployment, utilizing Google Colab as the development environment and fetching the dataset directly from a URL for seamless integration.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing & Aggregation**  
  - Automatic cleaning and aggregation of transactional data.  
  - Metrics such as total spending, purchase frequency, and average inter-purchase intervals are computed.  
- **Clustering Techniques**  
  - **K-Means Clustering**: Provides initial customer segmentation.  
  - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**: Identifies natural groupings and outliers for advanced segmentation.  
- **Visualization & Analysis**  
  - Comprehensive visualizations of customer segments.  
  - Detailed summaries for each segment, highlighting characteristics like spending patterns and retention potential.  
- **Strategic Recommendations**  
  - A final report provides actionable insights and strategies tailored to customer groups for improved business outcomes.  

## Benefits  
- **Personalized Marketing**: Tailor campaigns to specific customer groups.  
- **Customer Retention**: Identify at-risk customers and improve loyalty.  
- **Revenue Growth**: Leverage insights to create strategies for higher profitability.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
To get started, youâ€™ll need:  
1. A Google account to access **Google Colab**.  
2. Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` (these are pre-installed in Google Colab).  

### How to Use  

1. **Access the Notebook**  
   Open the project notebook on Google Colab using the following link: [Customer Segmentation Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19s8BTdVc8dRQ4uQlGRjbYXXMCKaHVWXA?usp=sharing).  

2. **Dataset Loading**  
   - The transactional dataset is fetched directly from a URL.  
   - Ensure your internet connection is active for the data to load successfully.  
   - The dataset contains columns such as:  
     - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.  
     - `transaction_date`: Date of each transaction.  
     - `amount`: Monetary value of each transaction.  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - The notebook preprocesses the data by:  
     - Cleaning invalid or missing entries.  
     - Aggregating key metrics like total spending, purchase frequency, and inter-purchase intervals.  

4. **Clustering Analysis**  
   - **K-Means Clustering** groups customers into initial segments based on their spending and frequency metrics.  
   - **DBSCAN Clustering** refines the segmentation by identifying natural clusters and outliers.  

5. **Visualization & Reporting**  
   - The notebook generates:  
     - Cluster visualizations for better understanding.  
     - Detailed summaries for each customer segment.  
   - A downloadable report with insights and strategic recommendations is created at the end of the analysis.

## Results  
The output of this project includes:  
- **Cluster Assignments**: A clear label for each customer, indicating their group.  
- **Visualizations**: Graphs and charts showing spending patterns, frequency, and other key metrics.  
- **Segment Summary**: Insights into customer characteristics for data-driven decisions.  
- **Recommendations**: Actionable strategies for improving marketing and customer engagement.
